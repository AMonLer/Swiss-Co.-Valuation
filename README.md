# Valuation
This repository contains the code and relevant spreadsheet to 
1. Pull financial statements of publicly traded companies from [FMP](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/)
2. Perform single DCF and Monte Carlo DCF valutaion 

I would like to wrap these functions in the form of a python library when I get a chance. If you can help me doing that please let me know.
